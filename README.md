# Final Project PSR 
## General Overview
In the last project, we used all the skills acquired from the previous parts of the course *Programming Robot Systems*. The main goal of this work is to develop a simulation of the game called *"Team Hunt"* using the available tools in the *Robot Operation System* [ROS] environment.
### Team Hunt Rules
Team Hunt is a simulation of a game with three teams in which each team consists of three players. The game is about hunting a player from the opposing team, although the other teams must also be careful, as other teams do not remain passive! 
Rules of the game: A player who has been hunted by the hunting team in the form of contact / collision contributes to the score for the hunting team's account. The team with the most points wins.
