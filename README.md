# Final Project PSR 
## General Overview
In the last project, we used all the skills acquired from the previous parts of the course *Programming Robot Systems*. The main goal of this work is to develop a simulation of the game called *"Team Hunt"* using the available tools in the *Robot Operation System* [ROS] environment.
### Team Hunt Rules
Team Hunt is a simulation of a game with three teams in which each team consists of three players. The game is about hunting a player from the opposing team, although the other teams must also be careful, as other teams do not remain passive! 
#### Rules of the game: 
A player who has been hunted by the hunting team in the form of contact / collision contributes to the score for the hunting team's account. Each game lasts 80 seconds.
#### Referee: 
The character of the referee was also implemented in the game. When a player has been hunted, he goes to a special zone for 6 seconds, then after serving a penalty, the hunted robot (player) returns to the arena to a random place.
The team with the most points wins.

## Program functionalities Overview

### Gameplay arena
In our project, three arenas have been implemented in which the game is possible:
- th_arena_1.world
- th_arena_2.world
- th_arena_3.world


## Usage of program

### Running the program [instructions]
Open a new terminal and enter the following command to run empty environment:
```
roslaunch p_playerName_bringup gazebo.launch
```
In new terminal type following command to add a specific single player:
```
roslaunch p_playerName_bringup bringup.launch player_name:=red1 player_color:=Red
```
To automatically add multiple players, enter the following command in the terminal:
```
roslaunch p_playerName_bringup game_bringup.launch 
```
In order to see the arena on which you have added players type following command in terminal:
```
roslaunch p_playerName_bringup bringup.launch visualize:=true driver:=true 
```
To start the game, enter the following command in the terminal:
```
rosrun th_referee th_referee
```

### Driver Intelligences
We developed two intelligences to drive the robots: one of them for a robot with one camera and the other with two cameras.
